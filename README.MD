This is an eclipse project, created with eclipse 3.4.2 and JDK 1.7 

Make sure to install OpenCV 3.1.0 on your computer
(see: http://opencv.org/downloads.html)
and adapt the referenced libraries

Run the launch config and use the sliders to narrow down 
the image shown in the "threshold" window to a colored object you want to track

Once you narrowed it down, activate tracking (activate morphops to stabilize the tracking)

Tested on Windows only!
